[[Published Version](https://rjmf.econs.online/upload/iblock/8db/Monetary_Policy_Surprises.pdf)]

This paper studies the monetary policy transmission in the Russian economy. The key question of this research is to determine how monetary policy affects the economy through currency exchange rates. I construct a series of monetary policy surprises for the Russian economy using the high-frequency identification approach. Many papers use futures on interest rates as monetary policy instruments; however, we do not have these futures on the Russian financial market. Therefore, I use different currency futures as monetary surprises because these futures are liquid, and they may reveal market sentiments. I take the dates when the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia made a decision on the key rate and look at the changes in the currency exchange market in a tiny 30-minute window. Next, I construct a structural vector autoregression model to show the effect of these surprises on macroeconomic variables. In the identification process, I use the external instruments approach à la Gertler and Karadi (2015). Finally, I compare the results with other methods (Cholesky decomposition). I find that a tightening monetary policy significantly increases the bond rate; moreover, the effect on inflation is not immediate, but appears after a couple of months.

#### Business Cycle Accounting for a Small Open Economy: The Case of Russia

This paper studies the business cycles of the Russian economy. This paper aims to find which frictions are more important for the Russian economy and, therefore, which sectors should be modelled in more detail. I start with the simple case of a closed economy with four distortions, namely, the efficiency, the labour, the investment and the feasibility wedges. However, a closed economy model fails to explain real business cycles in emerging countries. I extend this model to a small open economy to better fit the Russian economy. I have two main findings. For a closed economy, I find that the efficiency and the labour wedges account for most fluctuations in output and investments. The feasibility wedge can play at best the third role. However, for a small open economy, only the efficiency wedge successfully contributes to business cycles fluctuations. The role of the labour wedge is much smaller.

#### The Role of Religiosity in Human Capital

 In this paper, I examine the connection between religion and human capital. I want to find the effect of church attendance on human capital. Moreover, I use a non-standard measure of human capital, instead of years of schooling I use PISA test scores. I solve the problem of reverse causality using the instrumental variables. As the IV I take four groups of control variables: geographical controls, economic controls, religious controls and historical controls. The data about religiosity and PISA tests are taken from different surveys and available on the individual levels. I find that there is a strong correlation between church attendance and PISA scores, which can show the difference in human capital between religious and non-religious people.
